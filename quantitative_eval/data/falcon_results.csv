CS programs are more focused on the technical aspects of computing, such as programming languages, algorithms, and computer architecture. SE programs, on the other hand, are more focused on the business aspects of software development, such as project management, software testing, and software quality assurance. Both programs have a strong foundation in computer science, but CS programs tend to be more technical, while SE programs tend to be more business-oriented."
