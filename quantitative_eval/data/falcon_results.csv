Final year (third in CS and fourth in SE) are slightly different, in that, SE students will do another large in-house project and more SE electives, while CS students will do a slightly smaller project and a few more core courses and electives.']","The main difference between CS and SE programs is the focus on software development. CS programs are more focused on the technical aspects of computing, such as programming languages, algorithms, and computer architecture. SE programs, on the other hand, are more focused on the business aspects of software development, such as project management, software testing, and software quality assurance. Both programs have a strong foundation in computer science, but CS programs tend to be more technical, while SE programs tend to be more business-oriented."
