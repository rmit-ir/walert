Then, in the third year of the SE degree, students spend a whole year (roughly 40 working weeks) in an industry placement. They work in a software firm engaging in all facets of software development process, from design to deployment. Final year (third in CS and fourth in SE) are slightly different, in that, SE students will do another large in-house project and more SE electives, while CS students will do a slightly smaller project and a few more core courses and electives.', ""You have a range of Work-Integrated Learning options to choose from, some compulsory and others optional. If you're pursuing Software Engineering or any other professional degree, a year of industry placement and a final year project are mandatory. All students must undertake a capstone project in their final year, where they may work with an industry partner or simulate an industry environment. You will have a project supervisor for guidance. We also offer additional opportunities like summer projects and industry events, such as the ANZ hackathon, AIIA iAwards competition, and various coding and security competitions.""]","
Yes, a CS degree is generally considered a better option than an IT degree in terms of job opportunities. While both degrees offer a range of career paths, CS graduates are often sought after for their technical skills and problem-solving abilities, which are highly valued in the tech industry. Additionally, CS graduates are often more in-demand for roles such as software development, data analysis, and machine learning. On the other hand, IT graduates may be more in-demand for roles such as database administration",0.0,0.0,0.0,6.976620268376667e-232,0.30829092860221863,"I'm sorry, but I don't have enough information to answer your question."
