 The best answer is 1. ## Step 1: Review the documents to identify any mention of double degrees in CS.
Document 1 does not mention double degrees in CS, it talks about the importance of performance and skills in finding a job. Document 2 explicitly mentions a double degree in CS with Computer and Network Engineering. Document 3 mentions that a formal double degree is not provided but business-centric cross-disciplinary majors and minors are available.
